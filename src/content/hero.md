Not if I weaken first. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. What? We're not at all alike! Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Travel time to the nearest starbase? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. The look in your eyes, I recognize it.
